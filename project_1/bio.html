    <p>Hello! My name is Salem and I am a Chicago based software engineer. I also am a musician that has been working in the Chicago music scene for over a decade. Now, I am attempting to pursue my dreams as a musician while diving into a new field that is incredibly liberating! I hope to be a great developer while nuturing my creativity! I also wish to eventually pursue writing manga and learning how to animate. </p>
